# wind-profile-clustering

This repository contains the Python code for analysing vertical wind profile patterns in any dataset containing time series of wind speeds and directions for multiple altitudes. This analysis is the backbone of the [Clustering wind profile shapes to estimate airborne wind energy production](https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-5-1097-2020) paper, which has been published in Wind Energy Science.

The code has been originally developped for analysing the Dutch offshore wind atlas (DOWA) dataset. The DOWA file reading functionalities are compatible with the [time series files from 2008-2017 at 10-600 meter height at individual 2,5 km grid location](https://dataplatform.knmi.nl/catalog/datasets/index.html?x-dataset=dowa_netcdf_ts_singlepoint&x-dataset-version=1). Additionally, file reading functionalities are provided for the raw output files of the Leosphere WindCube v.2.1.8 lidar. Measurements of this machine at a location near KÃ¶ln in Germany for the first three months of 2020 are provided by GWU Umwelttechnik and are under analysis by an airborne wind energy (AWE) resource consortium, which aims for developing AWE system load case standards.
